# ApplaudoChallenge

This project was developed using [.Net Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) as main technology.

The following third party library were used:

* [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus):  simple and sane fake data generator for .NET languages.
* [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) Swagger tooling for API's built with ASP.NET Core. Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test operations, directly from your routes, controllers and models.

## Testing the API

Run the project from the console ``dotnet run `` or run it from visual studio,
go to [the swagger ui page](http://localhost:59904/swagger/).
